# Portal

Ever wanted to know what's happening around you? Portal enables you to join location-based P2P chatrooms using the map. It's a simple, privacy-focused solution that doesn't require any setup or registration.

## Getting Started

Visit [portal.live](https://portal.live)

And wait for p2p to establish :)

For running the frontend locally, start up a Vite server

```bash
npm run dev
```
